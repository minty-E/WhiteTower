# Library Management Program for WhiteTower

This is a program used for managing books, allowing the user to **store**, **delete**, **search**, and **view all books**.

## Using Main Menu
The main menu will appear everytime you finish a selected action. Be sure to look out for the output as it'll be located towards the top.

## Some Things to be Cautious About
- When the program is searching for a book from a query, it will search for all books relating to it, not only one. 
- Be careful; the program is case-sensitive!
